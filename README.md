## ✦ Overview

> A professionally curated C++ codebase developed during academic training at
> **Sunbeam CDAC**, with an emphasis on **engineering discipline**,
> **modern C++ practices**, and **production-oriented thinking**.

## Philosophy

* Code written for humans first, compilers second
* Strong fundamentals before abstraction
* Clarity, correctness, and intent over cleverness

## ✦ Highlights

* Written as part of **Sunbeam CDAC training conducted at our college**
* Daily practice focused on **strengthening C++ fundamentals**
* Explicit ownership semantics and memory safety
* Idiomatic use of STL over manual loops wherever appropriate
* Object-oriented design with clean abstraction boundaries
* Code optimized for **readability, review, and learning**
